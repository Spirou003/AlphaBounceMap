[example]
    all this section will be ignored by main program
    example = red green blue alpha
      if alpha is missing, using 255 as default (color replacement)
    example = typesector.param
      replace, if possible, typesector.param by the corresponding color.
      if substitution is not possible (invalid or cyclic reference), the statement is ignored
      [typesector]
        param = desired color for example's reference
    default = color used as basis for sector of type "example"
    onexplore = color used after exploration of a "example" sector
    ontarget = color used if a sector is of type "example" and also an target
    there is the following special sections:
        example: main purpose is to be a guidebook
        axes: configure color used to draw axes, differ from other sections
        display: describe the order to draw components (separated by space)
          order used: first in background, last in foreground
          used values: all except example, background, axes and display TODOOO
    note: names and values are case insensitive
